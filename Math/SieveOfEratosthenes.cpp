/*
  The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all primes up to n by repeatedly marking multiples of each prime as non-prime, starting from 2. 
  This avoids redundant checks and quickly filters out all composite numbers.

  Step By Step Implementations:
    Initialize a Boolean array prime[0..n] and set all entries to true, except for 0 and 1 (which are not primes).
    Start from 2, the smallest prime number.
    For each number p from 2 up to âˆšn:
       -> If p is marked as prime(true):
       -> Mark all multiples of p as not prime(false), starting from p * p (since smaller multiples have already been marked by smaller primes).
    After the loop ends, all the remaining true entries in prime represent prime numbers.

    Time Complexity : O(n*log(log(n))). For each prime number, we mark its multiples, which takes around n/p steps. 
                                        The total time is proportional to n*(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ....).
    This sum over primes grows slowly and is approximately O(n*log(log(n))) making the algorithm very efficient.
    Auxiliary Space : O(n)
